One common cause is a problem with the project's package.json file. Incorrect or conflicting dependencies can lead to this vague error.  Another source could be an issue with the Expo config file, app.json.  Errors within this file could also trigger a generic error.

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Check package.json:** Verify all dependencies are correctly specified and compatible.  Try running `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all packages are properly installed and resolved.
2. **Examine app.json:** Check for any syntax errors or inconsistencies in the Expo configuration file.  Ensure that all settings are valid and correctly formatted.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning your project's cache and rebuilding it. This can sometimes resolve conflicts. In your project's root directory, run:
   ```bash
npm cache clean --force
yarn cache clean
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```
4. **Check for conflicting packages:** If using multiple libraries, there might be conflicts between them.  Look for known incompatibility issues with your dependencies.
5. **Start in a different environment:** Try starting Expo in a different environment (e.g., create a new project). This could rule out issues specific to your current environment.
6. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure your Expo CLI is up-to-date. Run `expo update` and check for any relevant updates.
7. **Examine Logs:** While the initial error might be vague, consult the full output for any additional error messages or warnings that might give better clues about the problem.  If using a custom development server, check that server's logs too.
